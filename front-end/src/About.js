      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our website! As part of our CSE 611 project development course we built an online dictionary dedicated to helping you improve your vocabulary. We offer meanings for over 150,000 words, accompanied by word pronunciations in six different accents. In addition, we provide a feature for users to suggest new words, enabling our community to contribute and expand our vocabulary database.</p>
      <p>One of our key features is the inclusion of example sentences sourced from online news articles like New York Times etc. These sentences enhance your understanding of each word and its usage in real-world scenarios. We also offer special features on our website, such as the "Word of the Day" and "Trending Words," to further enrich your vocabulary learning experience.</p>
      <p>We value your privacy and strive to create a safe and secure environment for our users. We do not display any advertisements, ensuring a distraction-free browsing experience. Moreover, we do not collect any user data. Your privacy and trust are of utmost importance to us.</p>
